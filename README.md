#AnimatedTextures
![alt tag](http://nccastaff.bournemouth.ac.uk/jmacey/GraphicsLib/Demos/Fire.png)

This demo uses several sprite sheets of fire to generate an animated fire using billboards. The billboards are generated on the GPU using a geometry shader and the data for the frames / animation is passes using attributes.

Note this branch is an older version and will not be maintained as it uses the old OpenGL widget
